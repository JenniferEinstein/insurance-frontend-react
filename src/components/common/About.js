      <h2>About the Health Insurance Tracking App</h2>
      <p>Health insurance companies are enormously profitable. They do this thru a variety of methods, one of which is making it so difficult to get reimbursed by them that you give up. Don't let this happen to you. You can use this app to keep track of what you sent to which health insurance and when. </p>
